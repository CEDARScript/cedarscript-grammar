# LLM-Tool Interface

As Large Language Models continue to evolve and find applications in various real-world scenarios, there's a growing need for standardized ways for LLMs to interact with external tools and APIs. We envision `CEDARScript` as a potential solution to this challenge.

- **Standardized Tool Interaction**: `CEDARScript` could serve as an intermediary language between LLMs and various tools, providing a consistent, SQL-like syntax for expressing tool usage intentions.
- **Tool-Agnostic Commands**: By defining a set of generic commands that map to common tool functionalities, `CEDARScript` could simplify the process of integrating new tools and APIs.
- **Complex Tool Pipelines**: The language's SQL-like structure could allow for easy chaining of multiple tool operations, enabling more complex workflows.
- **Abstraction of API Complexity**: CEDARScript could hide the underlying complexity of diverse tool APIs behind a simpler, unified interface.

This approach could potentially enhance LLMs' ability to leverage external tools and capabilities, 
making it easier to deploy them in diverse real-world applications. Future work could explore the feasibility and 
implementation of this concept, aiming to create a more seamless integration between LLMs and the tools they use
to interact with the world.
