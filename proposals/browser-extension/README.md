# CEDARScript Browser Extension for LLM Web Interfaces

As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly accessible through web-based chat interfaces, 
there's a growing need to enhance their ability to handle larger codebases and complex file changes. 
We propose developing a browser extension that leverages CEDARScript to bridge this gap.

- **Seamless Integration**: The extension would integrate with popular LLM web interfaces (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) by leveraging [llm-context.py](https://github.com/cyberchitta/llm-context.py), allowing users to work with larger files and codebases directly within these platforms.

- **CEDARScript Translation**: The changes proposed by the LLM would be concisely expressed as `CEDARScript` commands, enabling more efficient token usage.

- **Local File System Access**: The extension could securely access the user's local file system, allowing for direct manipulation of code files based on `CEDARScript` instructions generated by the LLM.

- **Diff Visualization**: Changes proposed by the LLM would be presented as standard diffs _or_ as `CEDARScript` code, allowing users to review and approve modifications before applying them to their codebase.

- **Context Preservation**: The extension would maintain context across chat sessions, enabling long-running refactoring tasks that span multiple interactions.

This browser extension would expand the capabilities of web-based LLM interfaces, allowing developers to leverage these powerful AI tools for more substantial code modification and analysis tasks. By using CEDARScript as an intermediary language, the extension would ensure efficient and accurate communication between the user, the LLM, and the local codebase.
