# Fine-tuning a Model for Native CEDARScript Understanding

This initiative could enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of AI-assisted code analysis and transformation.

## Why Fine-tune?

1. **Improved Accuracy**: A fine-tuned model will have a deeper understanding of CEDARScript syntax and semantics, leading to more accurate code analysis and generation.
2. **Efficiency**: Native understanding of CEDARScript will reduce the need for extensive prompting.
3. **Consistency**: A model trained specifically on CEDARScript will produce more consistent and idiomatic output, adhering closely to the language's conventions and best practices.
4. **Extended Capabilities**: Fine-tuning could enable the model to perform more complex CEDARScript operations and understand nuanced aspects of the language that general-purpose models might miss.

## Approach

1. **Model Selection**: We will evaluate various state-of-the-art language models to determine the most suitable base model for fine-tuning. Factors such as model size, pre-training data, and architectural features will be considered.
2. **Dataset Creation**: A comprehensive dataset of CEDARScript examples, covering a wide range of use cases and complexities, will be created. This dataset will include both CEDARScript commands and their corresponding natural language descriptions or intentions.
3. **Fine-tuning Process**: The selected model will undergo fine-tuning using the created dataset. We'll experiment with different fine-tuning techniques, depending on the resources available and the desired outcome.
4. **Evaluation**: The fine-tuned model will be rigorously tested on a held-out test set to assess its performance in understanding and generating CEDARScript. Metrics such as accuracy, fluency, and task completion will be used.
5. **Iterative Improvement**: Based on the evaluation results, we'll iteratively refine the fine-tuning process, potentially adjusting the dataset, fine-tuning parameters, or even the base model selection.
