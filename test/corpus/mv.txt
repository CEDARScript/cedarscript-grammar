==================
Basic MV Operations
==================

MV FILE "src/old-file.js" TO "src/new-file.js";
MV FILE "config/development.json" TO "config/production.json";
MV FILE "temp/log.txt" TO "logs/app_2023-09-23.log";

==================
MV with Complex Paths
==================

MV FILE "/very/long/path/to/source/file.txt" TO "/another/very/long/path/to/destination/file.txt";
MV FILE "/home/user/documents/report.docx" TO "/home/user/Dropbox/shared_docs/final_report.docx";

(source_file
  (mv_file_command
    (singlefile_clause
      (string
        (single_quoted_string)))
    (to_value_clause
      (string
        (single_quoted_string))))
  (command_separator)
  (mv_file_command
    (singlefile_clause
      (string
        (single_quoted_string)))
    (to_value_clause
      (string
        (single_quoted_string))))
  (command_separator))

==================
MV with Special Characters
==================

MV FILE "/path/with spaces/and symbols!/@#/file.txt" TO "/new path/with-different_symbols&^%/file.txt";
MV FILE "/root/file_with_unicode_チ.txt" TO "/users/さようなら.txt";
MV FILE "/tmp/file\"with\"quotes.json" TO "/data/escaped\\backslashes.json";

        (single_quoted_string))))
  (command_separator)
  (mv_file_command

==================
MV Edge Cases
==================

MV FILE "/" TO "/root_backup";
MV FILE "/file_without_extension" TO "/with_extension.txt";
MV FILE "/source/./current/././file.txt" TO "/destination/../final/file.txt";
MV FILE "/case_sensitive/File.txt" TO "/case_sensitive/file.txt";
